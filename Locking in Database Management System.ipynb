    "A database lock is used to “lock” some data in a database so that only one database user/session may update that particular data present in the database. So, database locks exist to prevent two or more database users from updating the same exact piece of data at the same exact time. When data is locked, then that means that another database session cannot update that data until the lock is released. Locks are usually released by either a ROLLBACK or COMMIT SQL statement."

    "Suppose database session A tries to update some data that is already locked by database session B. What happens to session A? Well, session A will actually be placed in what’s called a lock wait state, and session A will be stopped from making further progress with any SQL transaction that it’s performing. Another way of saying this is that session A will be “stalled” until session B releases the lock on that data.\n",

    "If a session ends up waiting too long for some locked data, then some databases, like DB2 from IBM, will actually time out after a certain amount of time and return an error instead of waiting and then updating the data as requested.\n",

    "But some databases, like Oracle, may handle the situation differently – Oracle can actually leave a session in a lock wait state for an indefinite amount of time. So, there are a lot of differences between different database vendors in terms of how they choose to deal with locks and other sessions waiting for locks to be released."

    "The primary reason for database locks is to prevent the potential loss of data and information within tables or files that could happen when updates are applied concurrently within the database, i.e., at the exact same time. If different database users are authorised to change the database data at the same time then this could result in inconsistency within the database. But if the data were locked this would not be an issue. The locks tries to address this issue efficiently."
